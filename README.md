# üìà Modern Portfolio Theory Playground

A web-based interactive application to explore portfolio optimization using **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**. Users can simulate optimized and equal-weight portfolios, visualize portfolio growth over time, and explore the effects of rebalancing strategies.
